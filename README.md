# RIPE Atlas Blacklist

This is a blacklist of RIPE Atlas probes that using the conditions laid out by me gives undesirable results, most importantly having their DNS queries hijacked, but I also check the official status of the probes and if the probes consistently times out in which case they'll also get added to the blacklist.

There is support for adding entire countries to the list as well, but I have no intentions of adding any country to the list published here.

Feel free to use this however you like, contributions are very welcome as well even though I mainly created this for my own use.
